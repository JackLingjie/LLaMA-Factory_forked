       "  'completion': 'Certainly! A mixin in object-oriented programming is a class that provides methods to other classes through inheritance. It is a way to compose classes in a flexible manner.\\n\\nTo create a mixin that finds the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number, you can define a mixin class and then use it in another class. Here’s a simple implementation in Python:\\n\\n```python\\nclass TrailingZerosMixin:\\n    def count_trailing_zeros(self, n):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Count the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number n.\\n        Trailing zeros are created by factors of 10, and since 10 = 2 * 5,\\n        we need to count the pairs of 2s and 5s in the factorial. However,\\n        there are always more 2s than 5s, so we only need to count the number\\n        of 5s in the factors of all numbers from 1 to n.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        count = 0\\n        power_of_5 = 5\\n        while n >= power_of_5:\\n            count += n // power_of_5\\n            power_of_5 *= 5\\n        return count\\n\\n# Example class that uses the mixin\\nclass FactorialCalculator(TrailingZerosMixin):\\n    def factorial(self, n):\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        else:\\n            return n * self.factorial(n - 1)\\n\\n# Example usage\\ncalculator = FactorialCalculator()\\nnumber = 100\\nfactorial_result = calculator.factorial(number)\\ntrailing_zeros = calculator.count_trailing_zeros(number)\\n\\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial_result}\")\\nprint(f\"The number of trailing zeros in {number}! is {trailing_zeros}\")\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. **TrailingZerosMixin Class**: This class contains a method `count_trailing_zeros` which calculates the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given number `n`. It does this by counting how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`, because every trailing zero is produced by a factor pair of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5.\\n\\n2. **FactorialCalculator Class**: This class inherits from `TrailingZerosMixin` and has an additional method `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number.\\n\\n3. **Usage**: An instance of `FactorialCalculator` is created, and both the factorial and the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given number are calculated.\\n\\nThis code is a simple demonstration and can be extended or modified as per specific requirements.'},\n",
